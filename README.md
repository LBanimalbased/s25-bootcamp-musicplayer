This is my recreation of Spotify's UI when looking at an individual song. I chose to make it for music made by my friend Greg. The name of the album is Blorg, but you cannot actually find his music on Spotify, you would have to look on youtube. I think the white background is cool because you do not ever see it on Spotify - most black and white song images generate a dark background.
